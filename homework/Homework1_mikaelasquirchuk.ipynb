    "1. *Data Businesspeople* = \n",
    " * most focused on the organization and how data projects yield profit; \n",
    " * most likely to rate themselves highly as leaders and entrepreneurs; \n",
    " * most likely to have reported managing an employee (about 80% have); \n",

    " * have substantial academic experience, with about 3/4 having taught classes and presented papers;\n",
    " * common un‐ dergraduate degrees were in areas like Economics and Statistics, relatively few  have a PhD\n",

    " * most likely to identify as a Hacker;\n",
    " * had the deepest Open Source experience, with about half contributing to OSS projects and about half working on Open Data projects. \n",

    " * focused on the technical problem of managing data — how to get it, store it, and learn from it; \n",
    " * tended to rate themselves fairly highly as Scientists, although not as highly as Data Researchers did.\n",
    " * clearly writing code, probably production code, in their day-to-day work;\n",

    " * majority of respondents whose top Skills Group was Statistics ended up in this category, for instance;\n",
    " * nearly 75% of Data Researchers have published in peer-reviewed journals, and over half have a PhD;\n",
    " * least likely to have started a business;\n",

    "#### How to Develop Data Science Skills, George Roumeliotis (Intuit): \n",
    "> \"Data Science is its own unique discipline, combining elements of applied mathematics, computer science, business consulting, and, increasingly, new product development.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Focus shifted from marketing optimisation to UX to *leveraging big data and advanced analytics to create new products that solve important problems for our customers*. \n",
    "* Goal = Empower individuals and small businesses by allowing them to benefit from the power of their own data as well as the collective wisdom of millions of fellow  customers.\n",
    "* More specifically, the technical table stakes for a Data Scientist are *advanced statistics, machine\n",
    " learning, SQL and Hadoop, and a mainstream programming language like Java*. So there’s a combination of applied mathematics and computer science. \n",
    "* Business consulting skills = equally important, but often overlooked. Can be the difference between a Data Scientist and a Data “Gopher\" (someone who responds to incoming requests for analyzing this or that, but who never has a seat at the table when the business decisions are being made). \n",
    "* Need to learn:\n",
    " * R\n",
    " * a mainstream programming language like Java or C++. \n",
    " * a mainstream scripting language like Python or Perl.\n",
    "* Start with bottom line up front, rather than hypothesis-tests-results, in a business setting (cf. academia). Allocate time as if you are the business owner.\n",
    "* Build relationships with non-technical colleagues and practice viewing the world in terms of business processes.\n",
    "* A successful Data Scientist changes the world around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On Becoming a Successful Data Scientist, Hilary Mason:\n",
    "> \"A data scientist is someone who sits down with a question and gathers some data to answer it, or someone who starts with a data set and asks questions to learn more about it. They do some math, write some code, do the analysis, and then come to a conclusion.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "* Now the base infrastructure of data work is mature, and companies are working to make it easier to work with them.\n",
    "* Culture is important; data culture needs to grow.\n",
    "* Data scientists should function as the facilitator of asking and solving business questions. \n",
    "* Data science also involves story-telling - which is often neglected. \n",
    "* Working in a start-up with data is better than academia, where there isn't something collecting data already, or big business, where the data is stuck in databases or are highly controlled.\n",
    "* Start-ups are the perfect place where you have a product that’s generating its own data. As a data scientist you have input into how the product changes, so you can ask, “Can we collect this other thing?” or “Do you think if we tried this we might learn something else?” It’s very open as to what you do with it.\n",
    "* Look for good data sets. \n",
    "* When starting a project, the first question is: can we define the question we're interested in? The second question is: how do we know we've won? Thirdly, what's the first thing we will do with the output, as a business?\n",
