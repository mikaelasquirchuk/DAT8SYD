    "*Linear regression* is a way for us to map the relationship between one or several factors (called _predictors_ or independent variables) and another unknown factor (the dependent variable or _target_), in a _straight line_ relationship. One example is using the precipitation, yesterday's temperature and humidity (as predictors) to predict today's temperature (the target). It is best to use when you're trying to predict a number, like the temperature or the price of a car.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to find the line that best predicts the value of the target based on the predictors. One way is by _gradient descent_, which essentially finds the line with the lowest error and spits it out. So if the equation for the line is y = mx + b, the error of the line will be (y1 - mx1 + b)^2 + (y2 - mx2 + b)^2 + ... (yn - mxn + b)^2/ (number of x,y pairs). The closer the error is to 0, the better the line. It then finds the values of m and b that will result in the lowest error value. \n",

    "\n",
    "_R^2_ is a way to determine how well the \"linear regression\" finds the target using the predictors. It is a score between 1 and 0, where 1 is a perfect fit. Basically, it is the \"residual sum of squares\" (the sum of all the distances between the predicted line and the actual data point) over the \"total sum of squares\" (the sum of all the distances between the actual data point and the average target (e.g. the average temperature)). It is 1 - (diff between predicted + actual target / diff between average + actual target). You want this to be as close as possible to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "_P-value_ is how we test whether there is any relationship at all between the predictors and the target. The p-value is to do with the frequency of that occurring randomly. For example, there would be no point in performing linear regression to find today's temperature in Sydney which used as a predictor the price of fish in China. If the P-value is higher than a small decimal (normally 0.05), it means there is no relationship between the target and the predictor. You are generally hoping the p-value will be 0, showing direct correlation between the predictor and target.\n",
